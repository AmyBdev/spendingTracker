# Project Name: Category Spending Analysis

## Description
The application leverages the Matplotlib and Pandas libraries to manipulate CSV financial statements,
employing advanced data formatting techniques and performing intricate calculations to determine expenditures.

## Features
- CSV File Input: The script prompts the user to enter the name of the CSV file containing the expense data.
- Data Processing: The script reads the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame and groups the data by category, summing the amounts for each category.
- Positive Values: All negative values in the data are converted to positive values to ensure accurate analysis.
- Sorting: The total amounts for each category are sorted from smallest to largest.
- Printing Totals: The script prints out the total amount for each unique category.
- Pie Chart Visualization: The total amounts for each category are visualized using a pie chart generated by matplotlib.
- Chart Display: The generated chart is displayed on the screen.

## Usage
To use the Category Spending Analysis script, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries by running the following command:
```
pip install pandas matplotlib
```
3. Save the script code to a Python file (e.g., `category_spending_analysis.py`).
4. Prepare a CSV file containing the expense data. Ensure that it has a 'Category' column and an 'Amount' column.
5. Run the script by executing the following command:
```
python category_spending_analysis.py
```
6. When prompted, enter the name of the CSV file (including the file extension) and press Enter.
7. The script will process the data, print the total amounts for each category, and display a pie chart representing the distribution of spending across categories.

## Example CSV Format
The CSV file should have the following format:

```
Category,Amount
Groceries,-100.00
Transportation,-50.00
Entertainment,-20.00
...
```
Please ensure that the column names are spelled correctly and that the 'Amount' values are in numeric format.
